        1 Time Slot Package content: - A desk in the shared workspace - 3 hours of activities for your kid by certified staff in the play area, while you are working in the workspace (You are, of course, welcome to stay in the play area if you prefer). - Free wifi - Free coffee and tea, and of course, water - Kitchen with sink, fridge and microwave. Bring your own lunch for your child and yourself. Available time slots, from Monday to Friday: - 9:00am -> 12:00pm - 12:30pm -> 3:30pm - 4:00pm -> 7:00pm Send an email to diane.workingensemble@gmail.com to book a tour! *Note: Parent must remain on site and be readily available while the child/children is/are under our care. Note bis: There are 2 cats at the house. They are friendly and will certainly come to see who you are before disappearing for their daily "day long" nap. If you feel they can pose a problem, let me know and I'll set up a room for them during the time slot. I will, in any case, like I do just before every time slots, clean thoroughly the kids' area to remove any cat hair there could be.
