            Note bis: There are 2 cats at the house. They are friendly and will certainly come to see who you are before disappearing for their daily "day long" nap. If you feel they can pose a problem, let me know and I'll set up a room for them during the time slot. I will, in any case, like I do just before every time slots, clean thoroughly the kids' area to remove any cat hair there could be.
