	      	<p>May 17th, 2017</p>
                <p>Working from home with kids rarely feels like the best of two worlds. Instead, parents can feel like they’re 
                neglecting both their work and their kids as they scramble to meet deadlines and potty train at the same time.</p>
                <p>Whether you work from home with kids full-time, or you’re trying to adjust to a babysitter’s last-minute 
                cancellation, here are a few tips to sneak in more work when the kids are around:</p>
                <h4>Play games.</h4>
                <p>Mary Poppins sang it best: "In every job that must be done / There is an element of fun / You find the fun 
                and snap / The job's a game";</p>
                <p>Holistic nutritionist Sara Flint’s “Mom Boss life hack” is a fun one, just make sure you’re wearing comfy clothes. 
                You might end up sitting in the hall closet for a while:</p>
                <p>1. Play hide and seek with your toddler.</p>
                <p>2. Find really good hiding places.</p>
                <p>3. Check and reply to emails.</p>
                <p>Hayley Mullins, SleepBelt co-founder, plays “hair salon” with her youngster, letting the child do her hair while she 
                chats on the phone with clients.</p>
                <h4>Put the kids to work.</h4>
                <p>The Simple Dollar’s Allison Martin suggests recommends assigning your kids some daily tasks, whether those “jobs” are 
                colouring sheets and simple crafts or are actually helpful to your work: simple filing, tidying magazines, putting stamps 
                on envelopes, etc. Create an activity station near your workspace so you can “work” in tandem.</p>
                <h4>Use screen time strategically.</h4>
                <p>Instead of using screen time as a distraction while you prep dinner or take a shower, reserve it for when you really 
                need to get work done. (Macworld’s Joe Kissell admits technology can be a “lifesaver” for work-from- home parents.) Turn on 
                an episode of the Wiggles and grab a solid 20 minutes of uninterrupted bliss. Older children might enjoy “working” on an 
                educational iPad app as your work at your computer.</p>
                <h4>Rotate toys.</h4>
                <p>Practice the art of toy rotation. Kids get both bored and overwhelmed with the same huge selection of toys every day. Switch 
                it up by packing up most of their toys and introducing them to only a few at a time, rotating them out every few weeks for “new” 
                ones. Some parents swear by this, witnessing their little ones engaging more creatively — and for longer periods of time! — with 
                their playthings.</p>
                <h4>Have an arsenal of snacks and distractions ready.</h4>
                <p>Don’t go into a Skype meeting unprepared. Have snacks and distractions ready. If your child is old enough to understand that 
                you’re “working,” consider running a few emergency drills so your child knows not to interrupt you with important concerns like 
                the immediate need to read a Mo Willems book.</p>
                <h4>Don’t waste nap time.</h4>
                <p>The advice to “sleep when the baby sleeps” is great, but when you’re working from home, it’s just not practical. Take advantage 
                of those few precious minutes — or, hopefully, hours — by buckling down and getting to work. You’ll be surprised at how productive 
                you can be when the house is suddenly quiet.</p>
                <p>If your child is at the dreaded ditch-the- nap stage, introduce scheduled quiet time every day in their room. (There are some 
                great quiet-time tips at Everyday Reading.)</p>
                <p>Resist the urge to throw in a load of laundry or tidy up during this most sacred time. The only non-work “chore” that’s 
                acceptable here is making coffee. Make all the coffee.</p>
                <p>Lactation consultant Taya Griffin doesn’t waste potty time either: “It gives me a good 15 minutes if I line her up with a slew 
                of books!”</p>
                <h4>Trade off with another parent or two.</h4>
                <p>In all likelihood, you won’t be the only work-from- home parent in your neighbourhood or social circle. Instead of 
                booking play dates that you have to attend with your child, trade off mornings with other parents so you each play daycare 
                for one day a week while the other moms get some quality work time. (Bonus: The social time for the kids might wear them 
                out a little — and result in better nap times.)</p>
                <h4>Recruit outside help.</h4>
                <p>If Grandma’s nearby, use her. Lock yourself in your home office or bedroom — or bring your computer to the nearest 
                coffee shop or library. Even a few hours a week will make a huge difference. If Grandma isn’t nearby, consider hiring 
                a part-time babysitter when deadlines loom: have her take the kids to the park or an Early Years centre while you work.</p>
                <h4>Embrace routine.</h4>
                <p>Toddlers thrive on routine. Set a realistic work-from- home schedule that allows them to anticipate what their day 
                will look like. Maybe you go to the park together every morning before you start working (and they start playing with 
                those toys you just rotated in). Maybe they watch TV after their afternoon nap while you fire off emails to clients. 
                Maybe it’s mommy-and- me work time for an hour before lunch. Prep for the day the night before, so you have plenty 
                of activities to keep your kid busy during those scheduled work time slots.</p>
                <p>Recruit your partner to support this routine. If your partner works full-time out of the house, have them tackle 
                the morning and bedtime routines so you can get a good start and end to your day.</p>
                <h4>Let go of perfection.</h4>
                <p>Expect interruptions. Let the house get messy as your kids explore and create while you work nearby. Give yourself 
                buffer time so you’re not stressed when a project takes longer than it should to complete. Don’t expect to cross 
                everything off your to-do list every day. (Also, ask for a cleaning service for Christmas. Sometimes you just have 
                to outsource something. Mopping can be one of those things.)</p>
                <h4>Take the kids to work.</h4>
                <p>Get out of the house — and take your kid with you. Co-working spaces are great for freelancers, but aren't always 
                practical for parents with kids at home. Working Ensemble addresses the need for both a quiet workspace (and bottomless 
                caffeine) for you and quality childcare for your kids.</p>
                <p>You'll feel energized by the grownup interaction — no one will tug at your leg for hours! — and your little ones can 
                "shake their sillies out" with new friends. It's win-win.</p>
